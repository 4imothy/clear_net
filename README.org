** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)][C]] + Learn + Net
A framework for the creation and training of vanilla and convolutional neural nets only depending on a *C* compiler and standard library.

Check out some of the examples in the [[./examples][examples]] directory.

*Some Features*
- Creation and training of vanilla and convolutional models
- Autodifferentiation engine
- Stochastic gradient descent and other optimization methods
- Saving and loading a model to a file
